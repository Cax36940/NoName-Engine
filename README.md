# NoName Engine

This is a small game engine derived from a physics engine school project: [PhysicsEngineSrc](https://github.com/Boubounech/PhysicsEngineSrc)
The goal is not to create a fully functional game engine but rather to experiment and learn.

The project has been reset compared to the original version, and the graphics part is being entirely redone.
